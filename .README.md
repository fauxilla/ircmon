${pkg.description}

like autodl_irssi, but:

 * written with node
 * extensible
 * no irssi dependency
 * add torrent to deluge

Take a look at the awesome [annotated code](https://fauxilla.github.io/ircmon/lib/index.js.html)

## download & run binaries (not available yet)

This is convenient because you don't need to install nodejs & npm.

 * go to [release page](https://github.com/fauxilla/ircmon/releases) & download binary
 * copy `config.sample.hjson` from this repo to `config.hjson` in the same
   directory as your binary and configure paths
   [hjson reference](http://hjson.org/)

## clone repo & run from source

 * be awesome
 * install nodejs & npm
 * clone this repo somewhere like `/opt/`
 * copy `config.sample.hjson` to `config.hjson` and configure paths
   [hjson reference](http://hjson.org/)
 * `npm i` to install all the things
 * `npm run babel` to transpile code
 * start with `npm start`

## clone repo & build your own binaries (not available yet)

 * clone this repo
 * `npm i` to get dependencies
 * `npm run babel` to transpile to node 9
 * `npm run pkg-linux` or `npm run pkg-win`
 * binary will be output to `bin/`

## run from cli

__debug info__

If you run from source and initiate with `npm start` debug info will be written to the console. When running from binaries, you'd need to set a `DEBUG` environment variable to `undisco*` In linux, this is achieved with a command like `DEBUG=undisco* ./ircmon-linux-x64`.

__command line args__

Run with no params to see usage info.

If you're running from source the commands look like `npm start -- watch -l info`

## run as a service (linux) (not available yet)



## run as a service (windows)

no idea how to do this sorry.. help wanted.

## scripts

${scripts()}

## developing / testing / contributing

Suggestions / contributions are absolutely welcome.

Use `npm run babel` or `npm run babel:watch` to transpile source from `lib` to
`dist`, then `npm start` to run.

test with `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`
