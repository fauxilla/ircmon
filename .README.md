Take a look at the awesome [annotated code](https://fauxilla.github.io/ircmon/lib/index.js.html)

## libicu dependency

apt-get install libicu-dev


## download & run binaries

This is convenient because you don't need to install nodejs & npm.

 * go to [release page](https://github.com/fauxilla/ircmon/releases) & download binary
 * copy `config.sample.hjson` from this repo to `config.hjson` in the same
   directory as your binary and configure paths
   [hjson reference](http://hjson.org/)

## clone repo & run from source

 * be awesome
 * install nodejs & npm
 * clone this repo somewhere like `/opt/`
 * copy `config.sample.hjson` to `config.hjson` and configure paths
   [hjson reference](http://hjson.org/)
 * `npm i` to install all the things
 * `npm run babel` to transpile code
 * start with `npm start`

## clone repo & build your own binaries

 * clone this repo
 * `npm i` to get dependencies
 * `npm run babel` to transpile to node 9
 * `npm run pkg-linux` or `npm run pkg-win`
 * binary will be output to `bin/`

## run from cli

__debug info__

If you run from source and initiate with `npm start` debug info will be written to the console. When running from binaries, you'd need to set a `DEBUG` environment variable to `undisco*` In linux, this is achieved with a command like `DEBUG=undisco* ./undisco-linux-x64`.

__command line args__

Run with no params to see usage info.

If you're running from source the commands look like `npm start -- watch -p /srv/downloads`

## run as a service (linux)

  * copy binary or clone repo to `/opt/undiscombobulate`
  * create config in that dir
  * copy `undiscombobulate.service` into `/etc/systemd/system`
  * modify `ExecStart` and `WorkingDirectory` paths in that file
  * make your entry point executable, so `chmod +x dist/index.js` if you're running from source or `chmod +x undisco-linux-x64` if you're running binaries
  * make `dist/service.js` executable as in `chmod +x dist/service.js`
  * start with `sudo systemctl start undiscombobulate.service`
  * check logs with `sudo journalctl -u undiscombobulate.service`
  * start on boot with `sudo systemctl enable undiscombobulate.service`

## run as a service (windows)

no idea how to do this sorry.. help wanted.

## watching vs polling

In the options you can specify a watch option (true / false) or a poll option
(minutes or false). Watching file systems in general is pretty shady, it might
work for you, it might not. Polling isnt great either because theres always
a delay, and your hard drives wont go to sleep. So try watching and if that
doesn't work fall back to polling.

## modules

Undisco has a modular architecture, and is very easy to extend. You could create your own module in the root dir, then add the full list of modules to `config.hjson`
with the path `../myModule`. It might look like this:

```
{
  modules: [
    listFiles
    skip
    unrar
    readNfo
    parseName
    tmdb
    ../myModule
    placeholders
    ignore
    destPaths
    copy
    clean
  ]
}
```

Take a look in `/modules/` for examples of how modules work.

## scripts

${scripts()}

## developing / testing / contributing

Suggestions / contributions are absolutely welcome.

Use `npm run babel` or `npm run babel:watch` to transpile source from `lib` to
`dist`, then `npm start` to run.

test with `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`
